**Choosing the Right IPC Mechanism:**

The best IPC mechanism depends on the specific needs of your application:

- **Signals:** Simple notifications or short messages.
- **Pipes:** Streaming data between related processes.
- **Shared memory:** Fast data exchange between processes.
- **Message queues:** Structured message passing.
- **Sockets:** Network communication or flexible IPC within the same system.

- **Signals:**
    - `signal()` - To handle signals sent between processes.
    - `sigemptyset()` and `sigaddset()` - To manage signal sets used with `sigaction()`.
    - `sigaction()` - To define how signals are handled.
    - `kill()` - To send signals to the other process (likely SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2).
    - `getpid()` - To obtain the process ID for signaling.
    - `pause()` - To suspend the process until a signal is received.
    - `usleep()` - For precise timing and pausing between signal transmissions.
- **Data Handling and Error:**
    - `write()` - To send data to the standard output.
    - `ft_printf` (or your own implementation) - For formatted output.
    - `malloc()` and `free()` - For dynamic memory allocation, especially if you need to handle variable-length messages.
    - `exit()` - To terminate the process gracefully.

- **Pipes**
	- **Process Management:**
	    - `fork()` - To create child processes.
	    - `wait()` or `waitpid()` - To wait for child processes to finish.
	    - `execve()` - To execute commands within the child processes.
	- **Pipes and Redirection:**
	    - `pipe()` - To create pipes for inter-process communication.
	    - `dup()` and `dup2()` - To duplicate file descriptors and redirect input/output.
- **File Handling**:
	    - `perror()` and `strerror()` - To print error messages.
	    - `exit()` - To terminate the process in case of errors.
	    - `open()` and `close()` - To open and close files/pipes.
	    - `read()` and `write()` - To read from and write to files/pipes.
	    - `access()` - To check file accessibility.
	    - `unlink()` - To remove temporary files if you create any.
- **Memory Management:**
	    - `malloc()` and `free()` - For dynamic memory allocation if needed.

-  **Signals:**
    - `signal()` or `sigaction()` - To handle signals like `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) for graceful termination.
    - `kill()` - To send signals to child processes for process control (e.g., `SIGTERM`, `SIGSTOP`).
    - `sigemptyset()` and `sigaddset()` - To manage signal sets used with `sigaction()`.
    - `getpid()` - To obtain the process ID, potentially for signal handling.
    - `pause()` - Potentially used for waiting for signals in more advanced signal handling scenarios.

pipex
- **Process Management:**
    - `fork()` - To create child processes for executing commands.
    - `execve()` - To replace the child process's image with the command to be executed.
    - `wait()` or `waitpid()` - To wait for child processes to finish and retrieve their exit status.
- **Pipes and Redirection:**
    - `pipe()` - To create pipes for inter-process communication in pipelines.
    - `dup()` and `dup2()` - To duplicate file descriptors and redirect input/output for redirections (`<`, `>`, `>>`).
- **File Handling:**
    - `open()` and `close()` - To open and close files if needed for redirections or built-in commands.
    - `read()` and `write()` - To read from and write to files or pipes.
    - `access()` - To check file accessibility for redirections or built-in commands.

- **Memory Management and Error:**
    - `malloc()` and `free()` - For dynamic memory allocation (essential for handling command lines, arguments, etc.).
    - - `perror()` and `strerror()` - To print error messages.
    - `exit()` - To terminate the shell or child processes in case of errors.
- **String Manipulation and Utilities:**
    - String manipulation functions (`strlen()`, `strcpy()`, `strtok()`, etc.) - For parsing command lines and handling arguments.
    - `getenv()` - To access environment variables.
    - `chdir()` - For implementing the `cd` (change directory) built-in command.
    

**Others:**
- **Built-in Commands:** You'll need to implement built-in commands like `cd`, `echo`, `exit`, `env`, etc. These often involve file handling, string manipulation, and potentially other system calls.
- **Command Parsing:** A significant part of the minishell is parsing the user's input to extract commands, arguments, and redirections.
