# CheatSheet

**Basic Matching**

* `.` : Matches any character (except newline)
    * Example: `a.c` matches "abc", "a1c", etc.
* `\d`: Matches any digit (0-9)
    * Example: `\d\d` matches "12", "34", etc.
* `\D`: Matches any non-digit
    * Example: `\D\D` matches "AB", "c$", etc.
* `\w`: Matches any word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _)
    * Example: `\w\w\w` matches "abc", "A1_", etc.
* `\W`: Matches any non-word character
    * Example: `\W\W` matches "(*", "#$", etc.
* `\s`: Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline)
    * Example: `hello\sworld` matches "hello world"
* `\S`: Matches any non-whitespace character
    * Example: `\S\S\S` matches "abc", "123", etc.


**Character Classes**

* `[]`: Matches any one character within the brackets
    * Example: `[aeiou]` matches any lowercase vowel
* `[^]`: Matches any one character *not* within the brackets
    * Example: `[^aeiou]` matches any character that's not a lowercase vowel
* `-`:  Defines a range of characters within brackets
    * Example: `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter


**Anchors**

* `^`: Matches the beginning of a string or line
    * Example: `^hello` matches "hello world" but not "world hello"
* `$`: Matches the end of a string or line
    * Example: `world$` matches "hello world" but not "world hello"
* `\b`: Matches a word boundary (the position between a word character and a non-word character)
    * Example: `\bword\b` matches "word" but not "sword" or "wordsmith"


**Quantifiers**

* `*`: Matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding element
    * Example: `ab*c` matches "ac", "abc", "abbc", etc.
* `+`: Matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding element
    * Example: `ab+c` matches "abc", "abbc", etc., but not "ac"
* `?`: Matches 0 or 1 occurrence of the preceding element
    * Example: `ab?c` matches "ac" and "abc"
* `{n}`: Matches exactly `n` occurrences of the preceding element
    * Example: `a{3}` matches "aaa"
* `{n,}`: Matches `n` or more occurrences of the preceding element
    * Example: `a{2,}` matches "aa", "aaa", "aaaa", etc.
* `{n,m}`: Matches between `n` and `m` occurrences of the preceding element
    * Example: `a{2,4}` matches "aa", "aaa", and "aaaa"


**Groups and Capturing**

* `()`: Groups multiple elements together and captures the matched substring
    * Example: `(ab)+` matches "ab", "abab", "ababab", etc.


**Escaping Special Characters**

* `\`: Escapes a special character to match it literally
    * Example: `\*` matches "*" literally
