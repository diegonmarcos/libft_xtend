**What you'll have:**

- **Tailscale:** This is the core software that creates your secure network (a "tailnet"). It's known for its ease of use and strong encryption.
- **VPS (Virtual Private Server):** This is a rented server in a data center. It acts as your central hub for your VPN.
- **Your Devices:** These could be your laptop, phone, tablet, or even your home server.

**How it works:**

1. **Install Tailscale on everything:** You'll install the Tailscale app on your VPS and all your devices.
2. **Magic happens:** Tailscale automatically establishes encrypted connections between your devices through your VPS, regardless of where they are.
3. **Your own private network:** Your devices will be able to communicate as if they were on the same local network, even if they're miles apart.
