# Harvard CS Path to Data Structures

## 1. **CS50: Introduction to Computer Science**

   * **Focus:** Foundational computer science concepts and programming skills.
   * **Topics:**
      * Algorithms and problem-solving
      * Basic programming concepts (variables, loops, functions)
      * Data types (integers, floats, characters, booleans)
      * Basic data structures (arrays, strings)
      * Algorithmic concepts (searching, sorting)
      * Introduction to different programming paradigms
      * Languages: C, Python, SQL, JavaScript with CSS and HTML

## 2. **CS61: Systems Programming and Machine Organization**

   * **Focus:**  Deeper dive into how computers work at a lower level.
   * **Topics:**
      * Memory management (heap, stack)
      * Pointers and memory addressing
      * Data representation (binary, hexadecimal)
      * Computer architecture (CPU, memory, I/O)
      * Operating systems concepts
      * Languages: C, assembly language

## 3. **CS124: Data Structures and Algorithms**

   * **Focus:** Formal introduction to data structures and algorithms.
   * **Topics:**
      * Abstract data types (ADTs)
      * Linear data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues)
      * Non-linear data structures (trees, graphs, hash tables)
      * Algorithm analysis (time complexity, Big O notation)
      * Algorithm design techniques
      * Languages: Typically C++, Java, or Python

**Important Notes:**

* **Prerequisites:**  CS50 is usually a prerequisite for CS61, and CS61 is often a prerequisite or co-requisite for CS124.
* **Variations:** Course names and numbers might vary.
* **Alternatives:**  Other courses might cover data structures in specialized contexts.

# Stanford CS Path to Data Structures

This outlines the typical Stanford CS course progression leading to a more in-depth study of data structures and algorithms:

### CS106A: Programming Methodology

* **Focus:** Introduction to the fundamentals of programming.
* **Topics:**
    * Basic programming concepts (variables, data types, control flow)
    * Simple data structures (arrays, strings)
    * Problem-solving and program design
    * Language: Java

### CS106B: Programming Abstractions

* **Focus:** More advanced programming techniques and introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP).
* **Topics:**
    * Recursion
    * Abstract data types (ADTs)
    * Basic data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees)
    * Algorithm analysis (basic concepts)
    * Language: C++

### CS106X: Programming Abstractions (Accelerated)

* This is an accelerated version of CS106A and CS106B combined into one quarter.

### CS161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms

* **Focus:** Deep dive into data structures and algorithm design and analysis.
* **Topics:**
    * Advanced data structures (graphs, hash tables, heaps)
    * Algorithm design techniques (divide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms)
    * Algorithm analysis (time complexity, Big O notation, amortized analysis)
    * Languages: Students can typically use C++, Java, or Python for assignments.

### Key Differences from Harvard:

* **Earlier Introduction:** Stanford introduces basic data structures like linked lists and trees in CS106B, earlier than Harvard's dedicated data structures course.
* **Integrated Approach:** Data structures and algorithms are integrated into the introductory programming sequence, providing a more gradual and contextualized learning experience.
* **Flexibility:** CS161 allows students to choose from multiple programming languages for assignments.

### Important Notes:

* **Prerequisites:** CS106B (or CS106X) is a prerequisite for CS161.
* **Variations:** Course names and numbers might have slight variations.
* **Alternatives:** Stanford offers other specialized courses that cover data structures in specific contexts (e.g., for artificial intelligence or databases).
